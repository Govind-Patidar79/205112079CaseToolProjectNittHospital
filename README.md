PROBLEM STATEMENT

  NITT Hospital Management System


 This project gives the procedural approach how a patient gets treatment, details     
  about date of treatment and finally depending on different criteria like room     
  allocated, lab reports, treatment and medicine takenâ€¦..etc
  It reduces the manual work of hospital like (paper work, manual  receipt  ...etc).


Usually it happens with some patients when doctor called them second time for   treatment they forgot their medicine reciepts, lab reports so here problem is   doctor cant keep treatment continue without knowing previous treatment. In sort doctor will start treatment from beginning.
By this project application we can  reduce this problem 
Patient need to remember only reciept  number and all information of patients would be saved in database.
